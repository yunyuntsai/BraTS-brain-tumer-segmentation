# Biomedical Image Anlysis Final: Brain Tumor Segmentaion


Quantitative assessment of brain tumor is an essential part of diagnose procedure. In this project, we aim to use object segmentation method to distinguish tumor part from Brain magnetic resonance images.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of a 3D-UNet in the context of the BraTS 2019 challenge and intend to improve the segmentation performance by using weighted mean square error (mse) loss function.
