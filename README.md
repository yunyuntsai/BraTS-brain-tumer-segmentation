# Biomedical Image Anlysis Final: Brain Tumor Segmentaion

**Motivation:**</br>
Quantitative assessment of brain tumor is an essential part of diagnose procedure. In this project, we aim to use object segmentation method to distinguish tumor part from Brain magnetic resonance images.

**Our goal:**</br>
We demonstrate the effectiveness of a **3D-UNet** in the context of the **BraTS 2019 Challenge** and intend to improve the segmentation performance by using weighted mean square error (mse) loss function.
